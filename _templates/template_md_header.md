# Preconfigured starter code files for all CSV datasets of Berlin Open Data

### Open any tabular dataset of **Berlin Open Data** with one click and **get a fully configured Python Jupyter Notebook or R Markdown file**.

- The code files are **set with relevant metadata, descriptions, data links, and some starter code.**
- The idea of this experiment is **that you immediately can start analyzing the data with R or Python.**
- You can **open the Python notebooks with one click in Google Colab too.**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: To **download individual files from GitHub you need to switch to the file's `RAW` view and then `Right-Click-Save-As`.** Only so you get the proper file format rather than the HTML that GitHub yields.

Feedback is always very welcome ‚Äì simply open an issue.
